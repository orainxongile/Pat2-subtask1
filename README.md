//what is morse code
Morse code is a method of encoding text as a series of on-off tones, clicks, or light flashes that can be used for communication over a telegraph or other communication device. the sytem uses a combination of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals) to represent letters, numbers, and other characters. 

//why is morse code created
Morse code, either of the two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes, and space.The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signal, such as flashing lights. One of the systems was invented in the United states by American artist and inventor Samuel F.B. Morse during the 1830s for electrical telegraphy.This version was further improved by American scientists and businessman Alfred Lewis vail,Morse's assistant and patner. soon after it's introduction in Europe, it became apparent that the original Morse Code was inadequate for the transmission of much non-English text, since it lacked codes for letters with diacritics marks.

//an explanation of how the Morse code system works, including the use of dots and dashes
1. each character (letter or number) has a unique sequence of dots and dashes assigned to it
2. dots are represented by a short signal (usually a beep or a light flash) followed by a short silence.
3. dashes are represented by a longer signal (usually three times the length of the dot) followed by a short silence.
4. the sequence of dot and dashes for each character is unique and corresponds to a specific letter or number.
5. to transmit a message, the operator would tap out the sequence of dots and dashes for each character, using a telegraph key or other device.
6. the receiving operator would listen to the sequence of tones or watch the light flashes and transcribe the corresponding characters.

   for example, the letter "A" is represented by a single dot followed by a dash(.-), while the letter "B" is represented by a dash followed bt three dots
