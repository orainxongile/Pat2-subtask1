//what is morse code
Morse code is a method used in telecommunications to encode text characters as standardized sequences of different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs

//why is morse code created
Morse code, either of the two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes, and space.The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signal, such as flashing lights. One of the systems was invented in the United states by American artist and inventor Samuel F.B. Morse during the 1830s for electrical telegraphy.This version was further improved by American scientists and businessman Alfred Lewis vail,Morse's assistant and patner. soon after it's introduction in Europe, it became apparent that the original Morse Code was inadequate for the transmission of much non-English text, since it lacked codes for letters with diacritics marks.
